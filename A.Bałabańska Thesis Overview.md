**1.1. Defining Persuasion**

-   Aristotle *Rhetorics -* three key rhetorical elements that consistute a successful communication intending to persuade other people:

1. logos - rationality, order and logical reasoning of the message

-   Carl I. Hovland, Irving L. Janis *Communication and Persuasion: Psychological Studies of Opinion Change -* effectiveness of persuasion and the persuasive means of communication.

**a communicator, a communication, and an audience --** comparison of that model to

Shannon-Weaver model of communication published in 1949

+ 'Message Learning Theory'

-   William McGuire *Communication and Persuasion: Psychological Studies of Opinion Change -* the stages of processing a persuasive communication:

**presentation** -- receiver is exposed to the persuasive message

**attention** -- receiver pays attention to the content of the persuasive message

**comprehension** -- the arguments of the conveyed message are proccessed

**acceptance** -- receiver agrees with the arguments of the conveyed message

**retention** -- receiver stores the message in memory

**behaviour** -- receiver acts on the message and behaves in line with the argument

of the message

*+intelligence has both positive and negative influence on the success of persuasion process.*

-   R. Petty and J.Cacioppo - **Elaboration Likelihood Model** - two main routes of persuasion: central and peripheral.

-   Daniel J. O'Keefe *Persuasion: Theory and Research -* the importance of two criteria by means of which persuasion could be recognized, that is intention and success

-   Brief summary of 1.1 presenting main points, ideas and researchers

**1.2 Defining Manipulation**

-   Plato *The Republic --* presenting the notion of a 'noble lie' that is the ground for the future concept of manipulation

-   Dariusz Galasiński *The Language of Deception --* deception as a form of manipulation

Manipulation is never unintentional and cannot happen by accident. Quote:

'*is an attempt to to affect the target in such a way that his behaviour/action is an instrument of attaining the goals of manipulator'*

-   Teun van Dijk *Discourse and Manipulation -* the concept of manipulation in the context of following dimensions: social, discursive and cognitive.

**3 main features of manipulation:** the abuse of power, violation of social norms and illegitimate influence of the receipient of the message.

!!! *illegitimate* because of the inequality of members and the domination of one group that is introduced in the society.

**Chapter 2: Linguistic Means (Strategies) of Persuasion and Manipulation**

**(not completely specified yet, as I have a task to create a corpus consisting of at least 5000 texts, and only after analysing them, I can make sure that what I intend to write is actually true)**

-   politneness theory ( The more direct you are, the more persuasive is what you say)

-   Critical Discourse Analysis ( defining manipulation from linguistic perspecive) -- **van Dijk**

-   sub-chapter about NLP **BUT** not as Natural Language Processing (Neuro-linguistic Programming -- has a lot to do with persuasion and manipulation)

-   persuasive language patterns (numeruous sources)

-   example of Martin Luther Kings as a success of 'short repeated phrase' method

-   The Milton Model -- dr Milton Erickson
