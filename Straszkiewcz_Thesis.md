# My MA thesis
## _Consonant-vowel coarticulation in CVC syllables_

In this paper I will investigate the influence of different vowels on the preceding consonants in English words.
I will especially concentrate on the ones far away from each other at the vowel diagram and the ways in which they project some of their features to the consonants.
The core subject will be the allophones created through this combination and their properties.
Different minimal pears will be compared on the basis of allophones they contain.
Also, the length of aspiration, intensity, and pitch will be considered in the analysis of this process.


The study will be carried out with the use of PRAAT, a computer software for speech analysis.


 1. **Introduction:**
    * consonants are subjected to different phonological processes
    * phoneme is not an articulatory island

 2. **Speech production mechanism:**
    * vocal tract; muscles, cavities, and filters used in the production of sounds
    * vowel classification; vowel diagram - distinction: high/mid/low, front/back, long/short; diphthongs - distinction: falling/rising, closing/centering
    * consonant classification; manner of articulation, place of articulation, voicing

 3. **Phonological processes:**
    * aspiration; definition, focus on prominence in voiceless plosives
    * (?) vowel lengthening - occurrence of vowels before voiceless versus voiced consonants
    * assimilation - acquiring the features of neighbouring sounds, devoicing
    * **coarticulation** - definition, allophony, different properties of allophones, length of specific allophones, influence of different, varied vowels on the consonants standing before them

 4. **Research:**
    * analysis of different minimal pairs
    * length of aspiration
    * the influence of different vowels on preceding consonants
    * the farthest vowels on the vowel chart with the same consonant
    * (?) the length of vowels - influence of following consonants
    * the changes of pitch, depending on the length of words, e.g. the longer the word, the higher the pitch
    * intensity
    * formant transitions
    * formant properties
