##Title: Pure vowel naturalness of chosen Text-to-Speech synthesisers.

###Introduction

This paper is supposed to show the differences between old speech synthesisers 
([StevenHawking TTS](https://lingojam.com/StephenHawkingVoiceGenerator)) and the modern ones 
([ISpeech](https://www.ispeech.org/)).

###Chapter 1.Literature on speech synthesizers.
This chapter will contain the most important information about the progress in speech
synthesis up until contemporary times. Here will be mentioned works such as:
* 'Progress in Speech Synthesis' by Jan P. van Santen, Jan P.H. van Santen, Richard Sproat, Joseph Olive and Julia Hirschberg
* 'An Introduction to Text-to-Speech Synthesis' by Thierry Dutoit
###Chapter 2.Articulatory and phonetic description of vowels and their allophonic characteristics.

###Chapter 3.Methodology on evaluating naturalness of speech synthesizers.

###Chapter 4.Demonstration of speech samples of chosen TTS systems.
   In this chapter I will show analyses of audio clips taken from **StevenHawking TTS** and **ISpeech**.
I will be using praat software as a tool for the analysis. Here is the word "bad" in 
praat:
