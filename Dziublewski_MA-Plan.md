#### Introduction

**General outline**
The general aim of my MA thesis is to create a **frame-based model** for uncovering the various kitchen tools that are implied by the imperative verbs or past participles in culinary instructions, as in phrases like '_slice the cucumber finely_' or '_potatoes, boiled_' which respectively imply the necessity to use _a knfie_ and _a pot_. In order to facilitate research into this subject, I have already created a corpus of around 1.7 million or more than eight thousand cooking recipes. The corpus will then be analyzed from a frame semantics perspective where the implied kitchen tool will be seen as the result of the interaction of two frame elements of a cooking instruction: the instruction verb and the noun denoting the ingredient.

**Plan for the first chapter**
* A General Descriptive Grammar Perspective[^1]
  * _The Verb Phrase and its forms._
   A discussion based on Palmer’s _The English Verb_. I will begin with the introduction of the notion of the verb phrase as understood in general descriptive grammar terms, with the distinction between complex and simple verb phrases. From that point I will move to the distinction between finite and non-finite verbs, which in turn will also facilitate the showcase of possible word forms that an English verb can take, from a grammatical and morphological perspective.
  * _The Tense, Aspect and Voice Systems of English and the Past Participle_
   The above naturally leads to the discussion of the tense system as it applies to the verb, with the caveat that word form is not strictly tied to tense. The inquiry into tense will crucially discuss the past tense, and most importantly the somewhat related past participle forms, which are one of the two verb forms most relevant to my thesis. It also brings to light the difficulty of classifying past participles (either as verbs or adjectives) when following catenative verbs. Voice and aspect and how they are realized through various verb forms will also be given a brief discussion, especially with regards to how these differ from the mood and tense systems more relevant to the task at hand.
  * _The Moods, Summary_
   The analysis will end by turning the attention to the mood in English and the need for a better understanding of the imperative mood, as crucial for recipe text, which remains almost completely without mention in Palmer. Moreover it will be shown, that a simple grammar approach is not sufficient for the task at hand and more sophisticated theoretical frameworks are necessary, as the grammar approach on its own does not provide enough information about the verb and its environment (in this case about the implied tool within a cooking recipe).

* Insights from Syntax [^2]
  * _Most common syntactic structures found in a recipe_
  The move to syntax is necessary in order to capture the broader range of the behavior of the verb with regards to cooking ingredients and kitchen tools. First, the syntactic structures most common in recipes will be presented, simply in order to show that a grammar approach is not sufficient (these structures are for example subjectless, verb-initial imperative sentences or sentences containing null objects).
  * _Argument Structure_
  These structures will later be discussed within the various Argument Structure frameworks discussed by Jaume Mateu. Argument structure can be viewed semantically as a matter of assigning thematic roles based on the lexical unit (the verb) or syntactically where the verb establishes a rudimentary event structure (or even a construction in the Goldbergian sense) that can be filled in by other elements (i.e. objects).
  * _Summary_
  While this approach provides greater insight into the nature of the verb, it will be shown to still be insufficient to capture the elements not present but only implied in a sentence, or even for making predictions for the lexical contents of the adjunct, as it simply operates on the actually existing predicate arguments.

* Cognitive Approaches[^3]
	* _Langacker’s Prototype Model_
	 A succinct overview of the notions of schema and prototype leading to the exploration of the schema and prototype of the English imperative.
	* _The English Imperative in Cognitive Linguistics - Force Exertion_
	The Schema and the Prototype of the English imperative are presented with regards to the idea of Force Exertion put forward by Takahashi, where a prototypical imperative exerts a high degree of force. The instruction imperative used in cooking recipes will be situated within this framework, especially with regards to notion of Force Exertion, as it is rather unlikely that a cooking instruction exerts as much force as a direct order. At the same time it is not an ‘indirect directive’ in the framework of Takahashi (such as for example: “Could you pass me the butter?”), which makes the cooking instruction rather difficult to place.
  * Summary
  While this approach provides insight into the general workings of the imperative, it is not sufficient for the fine-grained selection of particular elements implied by the verb. It will be proposed that the Frame Semantics approach, discussed at length in the next chapter, provides a satisfactory approach for the analysis conducted in the thesis.

**Further research**
In the second chapter I plan to write about Charles Fillmore's Frame Semantics which will require further reading of his articles on the matter that appear in "Linguistics in the Morning Calm: Selected Papers from SICOL-1981" or in ["The Oxford Handbook of Linguistic Analysis"](https://books.google.pl/books/about/The_Oxford_Handbook_of_Linguistic_Analys.html?id=QCJ5BgAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y). It is crucial for my thesis as a general semantic frame capturing a given event incorporates both core and **optional** frame elements. An example of a an optional frame element is precisely that of a kitchen tool, as in: "_Slice the cucumbers finely (with a sharp chef's knife)_". I am hoping to reach the conclusion that it is possible to predict which instantiations of the optional frame element of a kitchen tool are possible based on the instantiations of the core frame elemennt of an ingredient and the verb phrase. The second chapter might also discuss a comparison between **FrameNet** and **VerbNet** as models for representing semantic knowledge and their potential effectiveness for the task at hand.

The third chapter will focus on the notion of the recipe as a generic text, its definition and its particular properties. A potential resource for this inquiry will likely be found in [_Culinary Linguistics: The Chef’s Special_](https://books.google.pl/books?id=zXVoAAAAQBAJ&dq=culinary+linguistics&source=gbs_navlinks_s). While most of the articles in the book discuss the recipe text beyond just a simple list of ingredients and instructions (which is essentially what my corpus is made up of), they nonetheless provide insights into these aspects of recipe text too, especially with regards to the syntactic structures. The recipe text will then be analyzed mostly through a syntactic lens, in order to characterize the strucures particular to the recipe, as well as through a semantico-cognitive lens, to examine how the recipe text is situated within the theoretical frameworks presented in the previous chapters.

**Creating a corpus**
I have gathered a corpus of roughly eight thousand cooking recipes from 11 different cooking blogs. The corpus is formatted as in the image below and contains the name, ingredients and instructions of a given recipe.![Recipe Corpus](https://i.imgur.com/4f9cnLM.jpg)
The cooking blogs from which data was gathered were selected mainly based on the availability of the data, that is on how feasible scraping these blogs for data was (more on scraping later). The gathered data was then pre-processed in order to remove any stray hyperlinks, html tags and css selectors and the data from 11 individual blogs was then all compiled into a single corpus.
In order to gather eight thousand recipes within a reasonable and humane timeframe I wrote a simple webscraper using Python and its [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) library, which goes through every page on a given cooking blog to access the hyperlinks to all the recipe posts, where it locates the recipe name, list of ingredients and the cooking instructions. Here is a snippet of the code for one of the cooking blogs:
```
import scrapy
from scrapy.spiders import CrawlSpider, Rule
from scrapy.linkextractors import LinkExtractor
class BBSpider(CrawlSpider):
    name = 'BudgetBytesCrawler'
    start_urls = ["https://www.budgetbytes.com/category/recipes/"]
    allowed_domains=["budgetbytes.com"]
    rules = [
        Rule(
            LinkExtractor(
                allow='budgetbytes.com/(.+)/',
                restrict_css='.archive-post'),
            callback='parse_recipe'),
        Rule(
            LinkExtractor(
                allow='/page/\d+',
                restrict_css='.page-numbers',))
        	]
    def parse_recipe(self, response):
            recipe_name = response.css('.title::text').extract()
            ingredients = response.css(".wprm-recipe-ingredient-name::text").extract()
            instructions = response.css(".wprm-recipe-instructions").xpath("li").xpath("div").xpath("text()").extract()
            yield {"RecipeName":recipe_name,"Ingredients":ingredients,"Instructions":instructions}
```
The code is adjusted for the urls and the particular css structure of a particular recipe but the general outline remains the same. After locating the specified data, the scraper can be ran to extract the data into an .xml file, with "RecipeName", "Ingredients" and "Instructions" constituting seperate tags. From that point the corpus is further processed as mentioned above, but I preserved the raw xml-tagged version of the corpus as well. The corpus will later be tagged for parts of speech in order to facilitate analysis of the relevant verbs and potentially tagged for frame semantic elements as well, and fianlly used in the final chapter of my MA thesis as the basis for my analysis and constructing the model for uncovering implied kitchen tools.
