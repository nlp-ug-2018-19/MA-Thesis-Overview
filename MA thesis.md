**The Differences between American and British Accents**

Abstract

Introduction

In the introduction, it is important to draw the reader&#39;s attention to the subject itself. It gets the reader familiar with topic of our thesis.

**Chapter 1   Theory**

In chapter 1 I would like to provide general information concerning British and American accents. I will focus on history and changes in accents of English. Chapter 1 will be mostly based on Dominic Watt&#39;s _English Accents &amp; Dialect,_ found on: [https://bbaenglish.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/english-accents-and-dialects-trudgill.pdf](https://bbaenglish.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/english-accents-and-dialects-trudgill.pdf)

As well as Petra Tibensk√°&#39;s _Comparative Analysis of British and American English,_ found on:[https://www.academia.edu/11039399/Comparative\_Analysis\_of\_British\_and\_American\_English](https://www.academia.edu/11039399/Comparative_Analysis_of_British_and_American_English)
  1.1 The definition of accent
  1.2 Development of accents of English
  1.3 Differences between British and American accents
  1.4 The separation of the accents
  1.5 Pronunciation differences

**Chapter 2  Research**

In chapter 2 I would like to do a phonetic comparison between British and American accents. To do so I will use _Praat._ At the beginning I will do and gather recordings and then I will load them into _Praat_ in .wav file. The program provides a spectrogram which helps with comparison of different accents.
