# THE JAPANESE PRONUNCIATION OF ENGLISH: #
## Phonetic and Phonological Conditionings/ Factors ## 
#### Agnieszka Rachlewicz, NLP ###
My MA thesis is concerned with a _comaprison_ of various aspects of 2 completely different languages, ie., **Japanese** and **English**. 

#### List of chapters:

##### Introduction
As most of my thesis will be concerned with phonology and phonetics of the aformentioned languages the introductory chapter "Introduction" will be filled with such topics as:
* the *writing systems* of the compared languages, 
  * Japanese: Kanji (content words), hiragana (mialny grammar useage) and katakana (for foregin words amongst others)
  * English: English alphabet
* *syntax*:
  * words order: SVO vs. SOV
  * prepositions before and after nouns
  * numerals and thier categories 
* and possibly *gramar*.

Here's an exert from this chapter:
>The most commonly occurring word order in English is subject-verb-object (SVO). In contrast, Japanese uses a different one, subject-object-verb (SOV). For instance, a sentence 
“Fireworks bloomed in the night suddenly.” can be translated into
「パッと花火が夜に咲いた。 」  (patto-hanabi-ga-yoru-ni-saita) which translates directly into “Suddenly fireworks in(to) the night bloomed.” The same sentence might be translated into English as “Fireworks bloomed in(to) the night suddenly.” The adverb “suddenly” may occur in English in both the initial and final position of a sentence, while in Japanese it cannot occur in the final position.

##### 1. Phonetics and Phonology of Japanese: phonetic and phonological factors
###### 1.1 Segmental Phonetics
###### 1.1.1  Presentation of vowel charts in both languages
To make the chapters easier to read I will attach charts of Japanese and English vowels and consonnats. The charts will be two seperate editted versions of the general international chart of sounds from [the IPA official website](https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/content/full-ipa-chart).
Here's one of the charts, the one comparing vowels. The pink circles concern Japanese sounds and the dark blue ones English. ![The Vowels Chart](https://github.com/AgggR/MA_Plan/blob/master/IPA2005_3000px__VOWELS.png)
###### 1.1.2  Description of consonants in both languages
Once again, the pink circles concern Japanese sounds and the dark blue ones English sounds.

###### 1.2 Prosody of Japanese
Explained.

##### 2. Phonological aspects of Japanese
Phonological possibilities and restrictions of Japanese spund system and their effect on learning English (esp. differences of sound systems).
###### 2.1	Phonotactics
###### 2.1 The sound /u/ (ku/ gu; shwa > u) vowel epenthesis and substitution 
###### 2.2	an > ah (‘short and clean’)
###### 2.3	l > r phonemic contrasts
###### 2.4 ash > e

##### 3. Analysys
Natives of Japanese trying to speak English. Issues described above. Reision of explanations for those issues.
