# THE JAPANESE PRONUNCIATION OF ENGLISH: #



## Phonetic and Phonological Conditionings/ Factors ## 



#### Agnieszka Rachlewicz, NLP ###



My MA thesis is concerned with a _comaprison_ of various aspects of 2 completely different languages, i.e., **Japanese** and **English**. 


#### List of chapters:



##### Introduction

Revised specific literature of topics that may be included in my thesis. Most common approaches and differences in scientific views on the topics.



##### 1. Phonetics and Phonology of Japanese: phonetic and phonological factors



###### 1.1 Segmental Phonetics



###### 1.1.1  Presentation of vowel charts in both languages



To make the chapters easier to read I will attach charts of Japanese and English vowels and consonants. The charts will be two separate edited versions of the general international chart of sounds from [the IPA official website](https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/content/full-ipa-chart).



Here's the chart comparing vowels. The pink circles concern Japanese sounds and the dark blue ones English. ![The Vowels Chart](https://github.com/AgggR/MA_Plan/blob/master/IPA2005_3000px__VOWELS.png)



###### 1.1.2  Description of consonants in both languages


And here's the chart comparing consonants.
Once again, the pink circles concern Japanese sounds and the dark blue ones English sounds.

###### 1.2 Prosody of Japanese

Explained.

##### 2. Phonological aspects of Japanese


Phonological possibilities and restrictions of Japanese sound system and their effect on learning English (esp. differences of sound systems).


###### 2.1	Phonotactics


###### 2.1 The sound /u/ (ku/ gu; shwa > u) vowel epenthesis and substitution 


###### 2.2	an > ah (‘short and clean’)


###### 2.3	l > r phonemic contrasts


###### 2.4 ash > e

##### 3. Analysis


Natives of Japanese trying to speak English. Issues described above. Reasons of explanations for those issues.


3. a. (note: possible place of the additional subchapter)
As most of my thesis will be concerned with phonology and phonetics of the aforementioned languages, I'll commit one subchaper to the other problems that might concern the Japanese as learners of English as a foreign language. These topics are as follows:



* the *writing systems* of the compared languages, 



  * Japanese: Kanji (content words), hiragana (mainly grammar usage) and katakana (for foreign words among others)



  * English: English alphabet



* *syntax*:



  * words order: SVO vs. SOV



  * prepositions before and after nouns



  * numerals and their categories. 




Here's an exert from this chapter (note!: the transcription of Japanese will be added later and will replace the romanization):



>The most commonly occurring word order in English is subject-verb-object (SVO). In contrast, Japanese uses a different one, subject-object-verb (SOV). For instance, a sentence 



“Fireworks bloomed in the night suddenly.” can be translated into



「パッと花火が夜に咲いた。 」  (*patto-hanabi-ga-yoru-ni-saita*) which translates directly into “Suddenly fireworks in(to) the night bloomed.” The same sentence might be translated into English as “Fireworks bloomed in(to) the night suddenly.” The adverb “suddenly” may occur in English in both the initial and final position of a sentence, while in Japanese it cannot occur in the final position.



##### Conclusions
