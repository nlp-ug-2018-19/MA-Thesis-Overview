# My MA Thesis
_by Natalia Niemczyk_


##### In my MA thesis I will focus on the challenge of sentiment analysis of movie reviews and the way both laymen and critics evaluate films.
As the target of my research I have chosen movie reviews (specifically the Sci-Fi genre), taken from the [__Metacritic.com__](https://www.metacritic.com/movie) website. I have already successfully gathered user reviews from said site with the use of the __ScraPy__ framework. ![alt text](https://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://scrapinghub.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/scrapy.png "Scrapy Logo")  
Next, I intend to collect critic reviews from the links provided by Metacritic (for which I employed the **Ditto** program).  

In the coming weeks I intend to focus on writing the first chapter of my thesis.

##### In this table I'd like to introduce the basic information on the main points and the process of researching of my thesis.
| Research question | How do opinions of critics and laymen differ? Sentimental analysis of online Science Fiction movie reviews. |
| :---: |:---|
| Data source | Movie reviews gathered from metacritic.com from Science Fiction genre section |
| Data collection method|Scraping of user reviews; copying critic reviews from sites linked on metacritic.com<br>Cleanup of user review data: removing HTML tags, reviews not written in English, noise<br>Corpus size of over 100 critic and 100 laymen reviews |
|Analysis method | I plan on employing a framework that will identify the needs and goals of the audience and whether they have been fulfilled by the movie in question (for example, the need of entertainment, knowledge, etc.). In order to do that, I will identify particular traits of product that evoke sentiment and link it to particular needs of the reviewers. I am not sure what exact tools I will use in order to perform this analysis yet |
|Quantitative or qualitative research?|More focus on quantitative method—statistical data will be used to draw conclusions about positive/negative charge of reviews and to investigate common patterns and expressions used to evaluate motion pictures |

##### Below I present the outline of the initial chapter on axiology:
1. Axiology as an interdisciplinary study of values *(axiology and evaluation are the reason and vehicle for expressing opinions, the main focus on sentiment analysis)*
    * Evaluation as an innate capability of human mind—how language mirrors reality and our systems of values, the ‘Picture Theory’ of Language by Ludwig Wittgenstein
    * Values thought universal started to be seen as negotiable and context-dependent
    * Axiology stems from ethics—a historical overview of philosophical approaches
    * Axiology in linguistics—Levinson points out it allows to find explanations for linguistic facts; evaluation as a narrative structure, evaluation as a necessary part of language and expression of emotions
    * Many faces of evaluation: overt/covert, various categories of evaluative act (judgement, irony, expression of feelings)
    * Phases of evaluation: ‘pre-textual’ decision
    * The importance of context, linguistic and extra-linguistic, that may affect evaluation
    * Stance, attitude, and evaluation: similarities and differences
    * Evaluation on the phonological, morphological, lexical, syntactic, and semantic levels
    * Evaluation as a dynamic system—a framework of the Dynamical System Theory
    * Summary: the definition of evaluation
2. Axiology in linguistics *(important as a basis for understanding how evaluations are formed and how they are expressed)*
    * Cognitive axiology scales in analysis of meaning: Saussurean and Chomskyan true–false scale and the lack of good–bad polarity
    * Structural approach
        * Charles Bally’s theory of need for evaluation in language formation, the distinction between value and logical judgements
        * Pierre Guiraud’s context and semantic ties of words and phrases that express emotions, intentions, and judgements
        * Bernard Pottier’s idea of axiology as a modality and one of key linguistic notions and semantic categories, influencing other modalities
        * Axiological connotation and denotation—evaluative meaning at the core of some words; Rosemary Sansome’s study on lexical connotations and the axiological subcategory of lexical units
        * Sorin Stati’s classification of axiological lexical units
     * Transformational-generative tradition
        * Krzeszowski’s and Kalisz’s positive-negative scale
        * Evaluation in transformational grammar framework as a semantic marker
        * Intensity and quality as parts of the evaluative semantic marker (Grzegorek)
        * The ‘reading’ of nouns as ‘good,’ ‘bad,’ and axiologically neutral in Jerrold J. Katz’s semantic theory
        * Affective grammatical-semantic feature according to Edward S. Klima
    * Summary: the evaluative aspect is innate to the communication and there are many theories trying to pinpoint and systematize the axiological value of language

##### In the next chapter I ~~will~~ might focus on the notion of frame semantics,
in which I could present the  description of the basics of frame semantics, with reference to ‘frames for evaluation,’ as well as introduce the basic information on the FrameNet project.
