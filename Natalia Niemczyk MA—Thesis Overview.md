# My MA Thesis
_by Natalia Niemczyk_


##### In my MA thesis, I will focus on the challenge of sentiment analysis and the way we express it.
As the target of my research I have chosen movie reviews (specifically the Sci-Fi genre), taken from the [__Metacritic.com__](https://www.metacritic.com/movie) website. I have already succesfully gathered user reviews from said site with the use of the __ScraPy__ framework. ![alt text](https://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://scrapinghub.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/scrapy.png "Scrapy Logo")  
Next, I intend to collect critic reviews from the links provided by Metacritic (for which I emplyed the **Ditto** program).  

In the coming weeks I intend to focus on writing the first chapter of my thesis.

##### In this table I'd like to introduce the basic information on the main points and the process of researching of my thesis.
| Research question | How do opinions of critics and leymen differ? Sentimental analysis of online Science Fiction movie reviews. |
| :---: |:---|
| Data source | Movie reviews gathered from metacritic.com from Science Fiction genre section |
| Data collection method|Scraping of user reviews; copying critic reviews from sites linked on metacritic.com<br>Cleanup of user review data: removing HTML tags, reviews not written in English, noise<br>Corpus size of over 100 critic and 100 laymen reviews |
|Analysis method: annotation or statistic? | Statistic:<br>Extracting sentiment phrases, finding the strength of semantic association between two words and average semantic orientation of the phrases |
|Quantitative or qualitative research?|More focus on quantitative method|

##### Below I present the outline of the intitial chapter on axiology:
1. Axiology as an interdisciplinary study of values *(axiology and evaluation are the reason and vehicle for expressing opinions, the main focus on sentiment analysis)*
    * Evaluation as an innate capability of human mind—how language mirrors reality and our systems of values, the ‘Picture Theory’ of Language by Ludwig Wittgenstein
    * Values thought universal started to be seen as negotiable and context-dependant
    * Axiology stems from ethics—a historical overview of philosophical approaches
    * Axiology in linguistics—Levinson points out it allows to find explanations for linguistic facts; evaluation as a narrative structure, evaluation as a necessary part of language and expression of emotions
    * Many faces of evaluation: overt/covert, various categories of evaluative act (judgement, irony, expression of feelings)
    * Phases of evaluation: ‘pre-textual’ decision
    * The importance of context, linguistic and extra-linguistic, that may affect evaluation
    * Stance, attitude, and evaluation: similarities and differences
    * Evaluation on the phonological, morphological, lexical, syntactic, and semantic levels
    * Evaluation as a dynamic system—a framework of the Dynamical System Theory
    * Summary: the definition of evaluation
2. Axiology in linguistics *(important as a basis for understanding how evaluations are formed and how they are expressed)*
    * Cognitive axiology scales in analysis of meaning: Saussurean and Chomskyan true–false scale and the lack of good–bad polarity
    * Structural approach
        * Charles Bally’s theory of need for evaluation in language formation, the distinction between value and logical judgements
        * Pierre Guiraud’s context and semantic ties of words and phrases that express emotions, intentions, and judgements
        * Bernard Pottier’s idea of axiology as a modality and one of key linguistic notions and semantic categories, influencing other modalities
        * Axiological connotation and denotation—evaluative meaning at the core of some words; Rosemary Sansome’s study on lexical connotations and the axiological subcategory of lexical units
        * Sorin Stati’s classification of axiological lexical units
     * Transformational-generative tradition
        * Krzeszowski’s and Kalisz’s positive-negative scale
        * Evaluation in transformational grammar framework as a semantic marker
        * Intensity and quality as parts of the evaluative semantic marker (Grzegorek)
        * The ‘reading’ of nouns as ‘good,’ ‘bad,’ and axiologically neutral in Jerrold J. Katz’s semantic theory
        * Affective grammatical-semantic feature according to Edward S. Klima
    * Summary: the evaluative aspect is innate to the communication and there are many theories trying to pinpoint and systematize the axiological value of language

##### In the next chapter I ~~will~~ might focus on the notion of frame semantics,
in which I could present the  description of the basics of frame semantics, with reference to ‘frames for evaluation,’ as well as introduce the basic information on the FrameNet project.
