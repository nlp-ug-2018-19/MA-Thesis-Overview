**MA Thesis â€“ Overview:

In my MA Thesis, I will focus on my research. I want to check differences in pronunciation of monosyllable words in English, in children aged 4-5 years old. The research will last for 3 months. 

In the first chapter, I will provide a technical aspect of my work. I will write about programs that I will use to examine the differences in pronunciation, about phonological preferences of children, why it is easier for them to learn an accent, how it is possible to see the differences, and I will write a few words about the place where I will do my research, about kids, their age, monosyllable words that I choose. 

In the second chapter, I will write how my research was done, providing screenshots of a program that I will use to see phonetic records of kids voices and I will describe every screenshot I will choose to give to my work. 

In the third chapter, I will show the differences or lack of them in pronunciation from day one to the last day, and I will explain why we can or cannot see differences.**
