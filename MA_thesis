## _Consonant-vowel coarticulation in CVC syllables_

1. **Introduction:**
    * consonants are subjected to different phonological processes
    * ?

2. **Speech production mechanism:**
    * vocal tract; muscles, cavities, and filters used in production of sounds
    * vowel classification; vowel diagram - distinction: high/mid/low, front/back, long/short; diphthongs - distinction: falling/rising, closing/centering
    * consonant classification; manner of articulation, place of articulation, voicing

3. **Phonological processes:**
    * aspiration; definition, focus on prominence in voiceless plosives
    * vowel lengthening - occurence of vowels before voiceless versus voiced consonants
    * velarization - light and dark l, conditions of occurence
    * assimilation - acquiring the features of neighbouring sounds, devoicing
    * **coarticulation** - definition, allophony, different properties of allophones, length of specific allophones

4. **Research:**
    * analysis of different minimal pairs
    * length of aspiration
    * the influence of different vowels on preceding consonants
    * lhe length of vowels - influence of following consonants
    * formant transitions
    * formant properties
