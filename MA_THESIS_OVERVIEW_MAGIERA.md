HOW DO SPEECH SYNTHESIZERS CHANGE PURE VOWELS? 
##CHAPTER 1
### 1.1A history of speech synthesizers.
In this subchapter, I want to present who invented speech synthesizers, when the first speech synthesizer was constructed, and who was the inventor of this device.
###1.2 TTS synthesis in a nutshell.
Here, I will describe the process of Text-to-Speech synthesis. I am going to explain the main rules of it, and present how this process works.

1.1	Machine learning and its up-to-date developments.
In this subchapter, I am going to explain the notion of machine learning, I will explain how it works, and I will present the most recent developments in this branch of IT.
1.2	How speech synthesizers are constructed.
Here, I’d like to present the speech synthesizers from a technical point of view, what subparts are they using, what algorithms they use, how they look like etc. 
1.3	How can speech synthesis be useful in everyday life.
In this part I want to present how speech synthesizers can be useful in everyday life, for example how can they help blind people etc. 
1.4	Genderless voice
In this part, I want to explain the notion of genderless voice and present how it may change the speech synthesis. 


##CHAPTER 2
###2.1 Analysis of previously recorded and prepared sound samples. Based on this analysis, stating whether speech synthesizers pronounce pure vowels in a similar way to human or not.  
Here, I will analyze the sound samples containing pure vowels, and according to the table of frequencies, which presents average values for pure vowels pronounced by an adult person, I am going to compare these values to those pronounced by the synthesizer. 


##CHAPTER 3 
### Survey 
I am going to conduct a survey to find out if people are able to differentiate the text read by a native speaker and the speech synthesizer.
